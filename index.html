This application aims to analyze Covid-19 data in Indonesia by utilizing datasets from Kaggle which are then processed and visualized through graphs and tables. The available features are to display the growth of new cases, deaths and recoveries in Indonesia and in each province in Indonesia in the form of a line chart for a certain period. In addition, there are also metrics to display total cases, deaths and recoveries. This project is suitable for use by the general public or parties interested in analyzing Covid-19 data in Indonesia quickly and easily.</p>

It was conceived as an expansion of the previous idea which was a formula application calculator with a display that was not user friendly. I led my cross-major friends in a computational thinking project. We created a container to hold python scripts that are used to solve mathematical solutions especially those that can be applied to STEM material. The background in this project was during a pandemic that required online lessons, I solved math problems more with python code than calculating according to the given formula.</p>
